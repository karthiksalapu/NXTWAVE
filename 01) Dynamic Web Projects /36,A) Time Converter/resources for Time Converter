The HTML input element for entering the number of hours should have the id hoursInput
The HTML input element for entering the number of minutes should have the id minutesInput
Add HTML label elements for HTML input elements with ids hoursInput and minutesInput
The HTML button element should have the id convertBtn
The HTML p element to display the converted time in seconds should have the id timeInSeconds
The HTML p element to display the error message should have the id errorMsg
By following the above instructions, achieve the given functionality.

When values are provided in HTML input elements with ids hoursInput and minutesInput, the HTML button with id convertBtn is clicked
The converted time in seconds should be displayed in the HTML p element with id timeInSeconds
The HTML p element with id errorMsg should be empty
The HTML p element with id errorMsg should display an error message in the following cases
When the HTML input element with id hoursInput is empty and convertBtn is clicked
When the HTML input element with id minutesInput is empty and convertBtn is clicked
When both the HTML input elements hoursInput and minutesInput are empty and convertBtn is clicked
Quick Tip
timeInSeconds = hours * 3600 + minutes * 60
Example: When the hours is 5 and minutes is 6, then seconds will be 18360
Note
Use addEventListener to attach events to HTML elements
The values given for the HTML input elements with ids hoursInput and minutesInput should be positive integers.
