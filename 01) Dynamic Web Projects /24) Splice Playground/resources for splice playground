Instructions:

Add the ids startIndexInput, deleteCountInput, and itemToAddInput to the HTML input elements correspondingly
Add an id spliceBtn to the HTML button element
Add an id updatedArray to the HTML span element with the class name updatedArray
By following the above instructions, achieve the given functionality.

Stringify the array given in the JS prefilled code using the JSON.stringify method
Fill the text content of the HTML span element with the id updatedArray with the stringified array
When spliceBtn is clicked,
If the value of the startIndexInput is empty, show an alert message to enter the start index
If the value of the startIndexInput is not empty, update the array using splice() method by passing the startIndexInput, deleteCountInput and itemToAddInput values
Stringify the updated array and update the text content of the HTML span element with the id updatedArray
Note
Write the code without deleting the prefilled code.
You can use the JSON JSON.stringify method to convert the array into a string.
If the value of the deleteCountInput is empty, assign the delete count to 0.
